        <p className='mb-4'>Before introducing myself I would like to thank you for visiting this marketplace project.
        Embarking on my first steps with React JS, Tailwind CSS, and Vite as a whole, creating this 
        e-commerce platform has been immensely helpful in honing my frontend skills.
        </p>

        <p className='mb-4'>Now let's talk about me. My name is Rub√©n Cuello, but you can refer to me as Sherlock. I'm a 
            34 years old advanced Software Development student with a deep passion for Web Development 
            and Data Analysis. My love for science, especially for math,
            has driven me to immerse myself in this ever-evolving tech world, where I can utilize my problem-solving 
            abilities and keen attention to detail. I love spending hours thinking in new 
            and exciting projects that force me to push the boundaries of my knowledge to the next level. 
            That's where I've been investing the last few months of my life. The path to becoming a Front-End 
            Developer is long, but it doesn't matter... I enjoy the ride!
        </p>

        <p className='mb-4'>Outside the realm of technology I have a few passions that I would love to share with you.
            You can often find me hitting the paviment exploring new running trails, or perfecting my 
            backhand in the tennis court. When I'm not actively engaged in sports, I find solace and 
            inspiriration in playing the piano, and diving into captivating books. As my nickname may 
            suggest, I'm a huge fan of world of crime fiction. Reading Sherlock Holmes stories with a good 
            cup of coffee at my side while in the background sounds smooth and relaxing jazz is the 
            definition of happiness to me. 
        </p>

        <p className='mb-4'>To sum up, I want to express my gratitude for your time and presence on this journey. 
        Sharing my passion for technology, my commitment to software development, and my insatiable thirst for 
        knowledge has been a true pleasure. I am excited to be a part of this vibrant community and eagerly 
        anticipate the opportunity to connect and collaborate with fellow enthusiasts like yourself. </p>
